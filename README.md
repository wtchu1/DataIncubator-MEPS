# Data Incubator MEPS project

Project explores the publicly available Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS) dataset from the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ).

Particularly, this project will focus on the dataset: MEPS HC-183: MEPS Panel 19 Longitudinal Data File 
Which can be access for free here: https://meps.ahrq.gov/data_stats/download_data_files_detail.jsp?cboPufNumber=HC-183

Below is a description of the dataset from the website:
This file is a two-year longitudinal file derived from the respondents to the MEPS Panel 19 sample. The persons on this data set represent those who were in the MEPS population (U.S. civilian noninstitutionalized) for all or part of the 2014-2015 period. The file contains a longitudinal weight variable (LONGWT) and all variables from the 2014 and 2015 full-year consolidated data files (HC-171 and HC-181, respectively). The weight variable (LONGWT), when applied to the persons who participated in both 2014 and 2015, will enable the user to make national estimates of person-level changes in selected variables (e.g., health insurance, health status, utilization and expenditures). In addition, LONGWT can be used to develop cross-sectional type estimates for the two-year period and for each year individually based on only the Panel 19 sample.
